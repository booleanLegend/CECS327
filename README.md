This repo includes the assignments, the correct answers to the midterm given, and the course presentation which we did via Zoom as there was not enough time in class.
You will use GNS3 for some of the assignments, follow the instructions, don't forget to compare prompts to ensure correctness. 
Sorry, I could not save the quizzes. I got a high B in this class since I bombed the final.
